# Wikipedia-Article-Scraping
In this project, we will take a personâ€™s name as input from the user and then scrape his/her Wikipedia page. All the scraped information will be written in a text file and then saved in the current working directory of the user. 

To start with the project, you should be familiar with the libraries like Requests and BeautifulSoup.
